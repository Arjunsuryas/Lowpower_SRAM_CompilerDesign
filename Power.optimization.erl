# Power Optimization Guide for SRAM Design

## Overview

This guide covers the power optimization techniques implemented in the Low Power SRAM Compiler. Modern SRAM designs must balance performance, area, and power consumption across different operating modes.

## Power Consumption Components

### 1. Dynamic Power
Dynamic power is consumed during switching activities:
- **Bit line charging/discharging**: Largest component during read/write
- **Word line switching**: Decoder and driver power
- **Sense amplifier operation**: During read operations
- **Clock tree power**: Distribution network power

**Formula**: P_dynamic = α × C × V² × f
- α: Activity factor (0.01-0.5 typical)
- C: Total capacitance
- V: Supply voltage
- f: Operating frequency

### 2. Static Power (Leakage)
Static power is consumed even when idle:
- **Subthreshold leakage**: Exponential with temperature and voltage
- **Gate leakage**: Through gate oxide (significant in advanced nodes)
- **Junction leakage**: PN junction reverse bias current

**Formula**: P_static = I_leak × V_dd
- Exponentially dependent on temperature and voltage
- Increases significantly with technology scaling

## Power Optimization Techniques

### 1. Multi-Threshold Voltage (Multi-Vt)

Uses different threshold voltage transistors for power-performance optimization:

```verilog
// High-Vt for low leakage (storage cells)
pmos_hvt M3 (.d(q), .g(qb), .s(vdd_int), .b(vdd_int));

// Regular-Vt for performance (access transistors)
nmos M1 (.d(bl), .g(wl), .s(q), .b(vss));

// Low-Vt for high performance (critical paths)
nmos_lvt M_critical (.d(out), .g(in), .s(vss), .b(vss));
```

**Benefits**:
- 30-50% leakage reduction with High-Vt cells
- Maintains performance in critical paths
- Minimal area overhead

### 2. Power Gating

Completely shuts off power to unused memory banks:

```verilog
// Power gating switch
pmos_header u_header (
    .d(vdd_gated),
    .g(~power_gate),
    .s(vdd_in),
    .b(vdd_in)
);
```

**Benefits**:
- 90%+ leakage reduction when gated
- Bank-level granularity
- Fast wake-up time

**Considerations**:
- Data is lost when power gated
- Wake-up latency (1-10 cycles)
- Area overhead for switches

### 3. Clock Gating

Disables clock to unused portions:

```verilog
// Clock gating cell
always @(clk or enable) begin
    if (!clk) begin
        enable_latch <= enable;
    end
end
assign gated_clk = clk & enable_latch;
```

**Benefits**:
- 15-30% dynamic power reduction
- Fine-grained control
- No data loss

### 4. Retention Mode

Reduces voltage while preserving data:

```verilog
// Voltage selection for retention
assign vdd_int = ret_en ? vret : vdd;
```

**Benefits**:
- 10x leakage reduction
- Data preservation
- Fast recovery

**Parameters**:
- Retention voltage: 0.4-0.6V (vs 1.0V nominal)
- Temperature dependent
- Process variation sensitive

### 5. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)

Adapts voltage and frequency based on performance requirements:

```verilog
// Voltage control
case (voltage_ctrl)
    3'b001: voltage_dac = 8'h40; // 0.4V - Retention
    3'b010: voltage_dac = 8'h60; // 0.6V - Drowsy
    3'b100: voltage_dac = 8'hA0; // 1.0V - Nominal
    3'b101: voltage_dac = 8'hC0; // 1.2V - High performance
endcase
```

**Benefits**:
- Quadratic power reduction with voltage
- Adaptive to workload
- System-level optimization

### 6. Banking and Partitioning

Divides memory into smaller, independently controlled banks:

```verilog
// Bank selection
assign bank_select = 1'b1 << addr[ADDR_WIDTH-1:BANK_ADDR_WIDTH];

// Per-bank power control
assign bank_power_gate = ~bank_select; // Power gate unused banks
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces active capacitance
- Enables fine-grained power control
- Improves access time for smaller banks

## Power States and Modes

### 1. Active Mode
- Full voltage and frequency
- All banks available
- Maximum performance
- Highest power consumption

### 2. Drowsy Mode
- Reduced voltage (0.6-0.8V)
- Clock gating enabled
- Slower access time
- 50-70% power reduction

### 3. Retention Mode
- Minimum voltage (0.4-0.6V)
- Clock stopped
- Data preserved
- 90% power reduction

### 4. Shutdown Mode
- Power completely off
- Data lost
- Zero power consumption
- Requires reinitialization

## Technology Scaling Impact

### Advanced Process Nodes (7nm, 5nm)
- **Increased leakage**: Exponential growth with scaling
- **Reduced voltage headroom**: Lower VDD limits retention voltage
- **Process variation**: Increased sensitivity to PVT variations
